                                Manual transmission cars are becoming increasingly rare, with many already gone extinct.
                                It's undeniable that their historical significance has diminished, leaving behind only
                                the joy of driving. Despite this, there are still around two dozen options for those who
                                prefer manual shifting. These remaining cars are the last of their kind, and it's likely
                                that manuals won't be around much longer. For die-hard petrol heads, we've put together
                                a list of the top vehicles still offering manual transmission.

                                        strengths are numerous, including ample space for up to five occupants. Notable
                                        features include its sleek design, roaring engines, and finely crafted interior.
                                        Manual transmissions are an option for the beefier trims starting from the R/T,
                                        allowing enthusiasts to personally experience the raw American power it exudes.

                                        Locating a midsize SUV equipped with manual transmission can be a challenge due
                                        to limited options. However, apart from the Jeep Wrangler and its variants,
                                        along with select Subarus, the new Ford Bronco emerges as a compelling choice.
                                        What sets it apart is its faithful adherence to its heritage, ensuring
                                        reliability even in rugged terrain. Additionally, this SUV boasts a wide array
                                        of customization possibilities, adding to its appeal.

                                        We dub it the premier small SUV featuring manual transmission. Its spacious
                                        interior hosts an intuitive infotainment system that enhances user experience.
                                        Opting for higher-level trims grants access to navigation and luxurious leather
                                        upholstery, all without sacrificing safety. Lane departure warning and emergency
                                        braking systems are standard across all trims. However, its 121-horsepower
                                        engine may feel underpowered on highways, a point worth noting.
