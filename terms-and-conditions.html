            <p>3. <b>Warranty Limitations</b>:</p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 500">3.1 </b>Warranty will not cover any labor costs and/or storage fee.</p>

            <p><b style="font-weight: 500">3.3 </b>In the instance of a defective part being delivered, Optimal Auto
              Parts obligation is limited to repairing or replacing the part/components covered under this warranty. If

              price.</p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 500">3.4 </b>Optimal Auto Parts, at its sole discretion, may opt to replace the
              original defective part with another used functional assembly of like kind with mileage equal to or
              greater than that of the original unit.</p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 500">3.5 </b>Replacement of any component or transmission or engine covered under
              this warranty will be considered a repair and will not change the length of time or terms of the initial
              warranty.</p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 500">3.6 </b>All warranty claims must be submitted within the warranty period

              rockers, and oil pumps. All other parts if included are considered accessories or extra parts. While
              engines may come with additional accessories, they are not always guaranteed with every shipment and are
              not covered under warranty. Components NOT covered under warranty include all bolt-on accessories,
              electrical control modules, wiring, sensors or ancillary items that may have been inadvertently shipped
              with the unit. Warranty is voided if engines heat tab is melted or removed.</p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 500">3.8 </b><b>Transmissions:</b> are warrantied to be in good working order
              against any slippage or shifting failures. Any accessories such as but not limited to: modulators,
              governors, electrical control modules, linkage, mounts, seals, gaskets or fluids are NOT covered under
              warranty.</p>
            <p><b style="font-weight: 500">3.9 </b>In order for the warranty to be valid, standard “Recommended
              Installation/Replacement Procedures” must be followed. Failure to provide proof of these steps being taken
              will void the warranty. Upon installation purchaser agrees to follow vehicles regular maintenance as
              recommended by manufacturer and may be required to provide proof of such activities in the event of a
              warranty claim.</p>
